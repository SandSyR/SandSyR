- 👋 Hi, I’m @SandSyR
- 👀 I’m interested in ... coding bots, websites, and games. I can do 1 of the three.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... the Python language! Please send help
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing really, but a Discord bot would be fun.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I have no idea. Comment on one of my YouTube videos (say something about coming from GitHub)  for now, but only if it's REALLY good stuff. Please. Link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZfvO4OQwscrXgGsJRSsbKQ
